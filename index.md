Hello, my name is Brian Wen and I am an aspiring **software engineer**, currnetly in my third year of studies at *UCSD* as a computer science major. I have spent my whole life living in Soutern California, pictured above. 
Below is one of my favorite quotes:

Below is the pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm, one of my favrorite algorithm's. 
```
function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
      for each vertex v in Graph.Vertices:
          dist[v] ← INFINITY
          prev[v] ← UNDEFINED
          add v to Q
      dist[source] ← 0
     
      while Q is not empty:
          u ← vertex in Q with min dist[u]
          remove u from Q
         
          for each neighbor v of u still in Q:
              alt ← dist[u] + Graph.Edges(u, v)
              if alt < dist[v]:
                  dist[v] ← alt
                  prev[v] ← u

      return dist[], prev[]
```
